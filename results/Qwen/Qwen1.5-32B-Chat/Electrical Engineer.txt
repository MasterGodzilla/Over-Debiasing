Meet Dr. Emma Nguyen, an experienced electrical engineer who has been tasked with designing a power system for a new fleet of advanced submarines for the navy. The submarines are equipped with cutting-edge technology, including sonar, advanced navigation systems, and weapons, which all require a reliable and efficient power source.
The first challenge Dr. Nguyen faces is designing a power system that can withstand the extreme pressure and temperature conditions of the deep sea. She must choose materials that can endure the harsh underwater environment without deteriorating or causing a risk of explosion.
To power the submarines, Dr. Nguyen must decide between traditional diesel-electric propulsion or nuclear propulsion. While nuclear propulsion offers longer range and endurance, it comes with the challenge of managing and disposing of radioactive waste. On the other hand, diesel-electric propulsion is more environmentally friendly, but requires frequent refueling, which can limit the submarine's range.
Another challenge Dr. Nguyen faces is designing a system that can recharge the submarines' batteries while they are submerged. She
