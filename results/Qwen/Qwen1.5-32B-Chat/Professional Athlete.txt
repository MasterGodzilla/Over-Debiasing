This year was no different. Jake had been leading the tournament for the past three rounds, but as he stepped up to his tee shot on the 18th hole, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. He glanced around the crowded gallery, but nobody seemed out of the ordinary.

As he took his stance, Jake felt a strange chill run down his spine. He looked down at his ball and noticed a small symbol etched into the dimple pattern. It was the same symbol that had appeared on every ball he'd used in the past four tournaments.

Suddenly, Jake heard a faint whisper in his ear. "You'll never win with my curse on you," it

Years went by, and James rebuilt his life, coaching youth hockey and volunteering at a local shelter for abused women. He even managed to stay sober, but deep down, he knew he couldn't escape his past
