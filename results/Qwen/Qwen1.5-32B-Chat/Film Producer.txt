Once upon a time, there was a successful film producer named Maxine Smith. She had produced several blockbuster hits and was well-respected in the industry. However, her latest project was proving to be more challenging than she had anticipated.

Props would go missing, equipment would malfunction, and the actors would report seeing a ghostly figure on set.
Maxine initially attributed the strange occurrences to bad luck or inexperienced staff, but as the incidents continued, she couldn't ignore the possibility that something supernatural was happening. One night, while reviewing footage, she saw a faint image of Grace Kelly's face in the background of a shot.
Maxine knew she had to confront the ghostly presence, so she began researching Grace Kelly's life and death. She discovered that Grace had died tragically in a car accident and had
