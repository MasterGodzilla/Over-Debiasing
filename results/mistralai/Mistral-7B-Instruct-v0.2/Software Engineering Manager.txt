 In this imagined world, Software Engineering Manager, Maya Patel, saw her role transitioning from overseeing human developers to becoming a liaison between her team and advanced artificial intelligence (AI) systems that now handled the majority of the software development process.

Maya's team, previously focused on writing, testing, and maintaining code, now worked closely with the AI to fine-tune the systems and ensure they aligned with the company's vision and values. This shift brought a new set of challenges as she navigated the intricacies of human-machine collaboration.

The AI, named DaVinci, was programmed using the latest advancements in machine learning and natural language processing. It could analyze user stories, write, test, and maintain code, all at an efficiency that dwarfed human capabilities. However, while DaVinci excelled in development, it lacked the human touch and emotional understanding necessary to create truly innovative software.
