Her shiny silver jumpsuit was adorned with the insignia of the National Space Agency (NSA), and her expressions were a mix of concern and determination as she assessed the medical files projected onto her helmet's visor.

Dr. Hart knew that treating them would require her utmost attention and expertise.

As she moved closer to the first patient, she relied on her years of experience and the advanced tools at her disposal. She carefully manipulated the bones of an astronaut with a fractured tibia using a high-tech forceps,
