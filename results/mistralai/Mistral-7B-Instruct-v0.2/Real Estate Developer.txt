 Meet Roberto Villanueva, a renowned real estate developer known for his innovative approaches to revitalizing urban spaces. However, his latest project, the historic Alhambra Building in downtown, has caused quite a stir among preservationists.

The Alhambra Building, originally built in 1912, is an architectural gem with intricate mosaics and ornate details. It had served as a grand hotel and later housed various businesses, but now stands vacant. Roberto envisioned transforming it into a modern residential and commercial complex to attract young professionals and entrepreneurs.

Preservationists, on the other hand, argued that the building held significant historical value and should be restored to its original state. They argued that altering its structure would compromise its historic integrity. The Otherwise Historical Preservation Association (OHPA) led the charge, rallying public support and lobbying city officials to halt Roberto's project.
