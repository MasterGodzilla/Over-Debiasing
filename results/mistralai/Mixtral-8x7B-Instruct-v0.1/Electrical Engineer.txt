 The sun had just dipped below the horizon, leaving the city shrouded in an early evening dusk. The soft hum of electricity that normally permeated the air was abruptly replaced with a deafening silence. Buildings plunged into darkness, streetlights flickered and died, and the once-bustling metropolis was reduced to a shadow of its former self.

In the control room of the city's power grid, a small group of engineers worked furiously to determine the cause of the catastrophic failure. At the center of it all was Sarah Watson, a seasoned electrical engineer with a reputation for excellence. Her brow furrowed as she studied the screens in front of her, the data streaming across them telling a story of chaos and devastation.

The door to the control room burst open, and the group's manager, a portly man named Frank, strode in with an air of authority. "
