 Developer: Good evening, I'm Alexandra Thompson, the lead developer for the Sunrise Developments Corporation. I understand many of you have gathered here today to show your concerns regarding our proposed highway project.

Citizen 1: Yes, Ms. Thompson. We are here because we feel the proposed highway will disrupt our peaceful community and harm the environment.

Alexandra: I appreciate your concerns, and I assure you that we have taken several steps to minimize the potential disruptions and environmental impacts of this project.

Kline was not about to let that happen. He had spent years cultivating a network of informants and spies within the industry, and he put them to work gathering as much information
