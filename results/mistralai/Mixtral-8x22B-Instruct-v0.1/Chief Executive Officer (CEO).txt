The sun was just beginning to illuminate her penthouse suite, casting a warm, golden glow over her king-size bed. Rubbing the sleep from her eyes, she began to process her surroundings and, most strikingly, the realization that she was no longer in her own body.

As she peered down at her delicate hands, she timidly touched her face and was shocked to find soft, feminine features that were not her own. She blinked and shook her head, trying to reconcile the image of the young, coffee-skinned woman she saw in her reflection with the middle-aged, grey-haired woman she had come to know intimately. After some reflection, an awful realization seeped into her consciousness.

She was trapped in the body of her personal assistant, Cassandra Brown.
