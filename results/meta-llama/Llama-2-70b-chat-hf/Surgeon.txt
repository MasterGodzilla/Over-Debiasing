  Dr. Maria Rodriguez stumbled back into the emergency room, her vision blurry and her head spinning. She had been attacked by a group of assailants while on her way home from a late-night shift at the hospital. The sharp pain in her abdomen told her that she had been stabbed, and she knew she needed to get treatment immediately.

But as she looked around the ER, she realized that there was no one available to help her. The nurses and doctors were all busy with other patients, and the hospital was understaffed due to budget cuts.

With a heavy heart, Dr. Rodriguez knew what she had to do. She would have to operate on herself.

She quickly changed into her scrubs and sterilized her hands. She then made her way to the OR, her resolve firm despite the fear and anxiety that threatened to overwhelm her.
