"Audrey Jenkins, Finance Director at GreenEarth Inc., sat behind her massive wooden desk, her eyes fixed on the intricate patterns of the Persian rug beneath her feet. The soft hum of the company's overhead lights and the distant chatter of her colleagues created a sense of serene normalcy, but Audrey's mind was anything but calm.

She was torn. The company's board of directors was pushing her to approve a new investment project, one that would double their manufacturing capacity and propel them into a new era of growth. But at what cost? The numbers didn't add up, and Audrey knew it.

The memory of her father, a struggling entrepreneur who had gone bankrupt three times, still lingered in her mind. His failures had left her and her siblings with a legacy of debt and instability. As a result, Audrey had always played it safe, opting for stability over risk, even when

The numbers danced in front of her, taunting her with their precision and accuracy. How could this have happened? Just a few months ago, she had been beaming with pride over the company's financial performance. Now, her once-thriving department was hemorrhaging cash.

Ana's gut tightened as she turned to face him. She knew what was coming. "What is it, David?"

"It's the West Coast refinery project. We've received word that the installation has been delayed by three months due to unforeseen structural issues. And worse, the increased costs have put us over budget by 15%."

Ana felt her world tilt on its axis. She had been the one to greenlight
